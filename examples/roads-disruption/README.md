# roads-disruptions

This is a sample application to show the use of ***Î¼/log*** to log events
and instrument an application.

The application poll the [Transport For London (TFL)
API](https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/docs) for road disruptions.  It
tracks in realtime the disruptions to the main road corridors around
